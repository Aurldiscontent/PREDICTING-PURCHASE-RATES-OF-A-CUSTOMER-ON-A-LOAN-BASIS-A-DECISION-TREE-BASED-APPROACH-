# Decision Tree Classifier: Customer Purchase Prediction
This project focuses on developing a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. By analyzing factors such as age, income, gender, browsing history, past purchases, and engagement levels, the model identifies patterns that influence purchasing decisions. Decision trees provide an intuitive, rule-based approach, making them easy to interpret and effective for classification problems.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using algorithms like ID3, CART, or C4.5. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques like pruning and hyperparameter tuning help improve model efficiency and prevent overfitting. This classifier can be applied in marketing, e-commerce, and customer segmentation to optimize business strategies and enhance targeted advertising efforts.
